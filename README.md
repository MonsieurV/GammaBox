> Your home radiation sensor

The Gamma Box monitors your home background radiation level, allowing you to share your Geiger Counter readings and get notified in case of high-level radiations.

The Gamma Box aims to educate and give a sense of how ans when radiations occurs to invaduals. It may also contribute to constitute a dense network of real-time Gamma ray sensors, for the joy of [hobbyists](http://radmon.org/) as for the gathering of [open-data](http://safecast.org/).

Technically Gamma Box is a box currently composed of a [Raspberry Pi 2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/) interfaced with the [Radiation Watch Pocket Geiger counter](http://www.radiation-watch.co.uk/) (using [PiPocketGeiger](https://github.com/MonsieurV/PiPocketGeiger) driver). It may support other sensors if you gently [ask](https://github.com/MonsieurV/GammaBox/issues). :-)
